@* 
   _ViewStart.cshtml runs before every view in this folder (and subfolders).
   Setting Layout here means every page uses _Layout.cshtml as its "wrapper" — the shared header, nav, and footer.
   You can override Layout in a specific view if you needed a different layout.

@{
    Layout = "_Layout";

@* 
   The block below is a Razor code block. It runs when the view is rendered.
   ViewData["Title"] is used by _Layout.cshtml in the <title> tag and for the page heading if needed.
*@
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home";
}

@* This is the main content for the home page. The _Layout wraps this in the shared header, nav, and footer. *@
<div class="text-center">
    <h1 class="display-4">The Joel Hilton Film Collection</h1>
    @* ~/ means "start from the web root" (wwwroot). So ~/images/... looks in wwwroot/images. *@
    <img src="~/images/joel_hilton_headshot.jpg" alt="Joel Hilton" class="img-fluid rounded mt-3" style="max-width: 400px;" />
</div>
